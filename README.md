# Forecasting-of-Solar-Irradiance-using-BPTT
• The goal was to predict the solar irradiance values for multiple look ahead predictions with time intervals as
small as 15 minutes; online form of back propagation through time was implemented on MATLAB.

• The performance of the proposed network was tested comprehensively using two years of data and it
outperformed the persistence model and the normal recurrent network; Research paper presented at the 20th
IEEE International Computer Science and Engineering Conference (ICSEC), 2016.
